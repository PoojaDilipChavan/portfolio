### Outline 

##### High-Level Summary 
###### Coffee : a filtered Perception 

I would like to talk about how coffee growing is not a profitable business for the farmers. I will be focusing on different reasons for it like producing countries and different middleman in supplychain. In the end, I will introudce some calls to action on industry and personal level.

##### Project Structure 

###### Setup 
1. Quote about coffee - 'Good Ideas start with coffee'
2. Coffee Statistics - How many people drink it? How much money did we spend on coffee?

###### Conflict
3. Assume coffee farmers are wealthy, Throw in statistics for farmer earnings 
Hayder Hassan, 53, produces two and a half kilos of coffee and 15 bundles of chat from his dark ebony soil. But since the drop in price he now earns little more than 35 cents a day from his small plot of land and is considering removing coffee altogether. - NY Times 
Visulization about coffee earnings for growers 

4. Reason 1 - Coffee bean to cup process cycle - 2 to 6 middleman

5. Reason 2 Geographical Regions - Coffee Production - Which countries produce the coffee?

###### Resolution

6. Resolution 1 - Fair Trade Prices , encourage all organizations to adapt it - McDonald's and Dunkin Donuts

7. Resolution 2 - Encourge coffee business which pay fair price to farmers - Procter & Gamble-U.S. brand Folgers

8. Personal level - buy coffee from brands that give back to farmers - Humblemaker Coffee Co. , Torke coffee

### Data 
The datasets I would use for this project are available on the international coffee organization. 
For Coffee Production by country, I will use data from [ICO Organization Link](https://www.ico.org/new_historical.asp). This will be presented in different chart types like maps and chartshart.
I will use a line chart from this data to show the Coffee Prices over period.
[ICO Coffee prices Link](https://www.ico.org/coffee_prices.asp)


### Method and Medium 
I would be using shorthand for the presentation of my story. For different visualizations to incorporate in the shorthand, I will use tableau or Power BI for chart making process.
I will be adding different images for coffee quotes and to express the timeline of the bean-to-cup journey. 
To focus on each step of the workflow, I will use focus/highlighting features on timeline.
