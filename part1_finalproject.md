### Outline 

##### High-Level Summary 
###### Crushed, brewed, Poured - The story of the bean
I would like to talk about the journey of the coffee bean in this project. It will include coffee production in different nations, 
a timeline of the production,  the business workflow, and the consumption of coffee.

##### Project Structure 
1. Quote about coffee - 'Good Ideas start with coffee'
 
2. Coffee Statistics 
  	* How many people drink it?
  	* How much money did we spend on coffee?

3. Coffee bean to cup process cycle - Timeline map 
	* Roasting
	* Griding
	* Brewing 

4. Coffee Production 
  	* Which countries produce the coffee?
  	* How production over time has increased ?

5. Coffee Consumption

### Data 
The datasets I would use for this project are available on the international coffee organization. 
For Coffee Production and Consumption data by country, I will use data from [Link](https://www.ico.org/new_historical.asp). This will be presented in different chart types like maps and chartshart.
I will use a line chart from this data to show the Coffee Prices over period.

### Method and Medium 
I would be using shorthand for the presentation of my story. For different visualizations to incorporate in the shorthand, I will use tableau or Power BI for chart making process.
I will be adding different images for coffee quotes and to express the timeline of the bean-to-cup journey. 
To focus on each step of the workflow, I will use focus/highlighting features on timeline.
