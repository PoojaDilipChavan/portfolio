##### Bar Chart : Year 2021 Debt-to-GDP Ratio
The below bar chart shows general goverment debts as the % of total GDP for year 2021. As seen, Japan has the highest value (highlighted).

##### Grid of line Charts : Year 1995-2021 Debt-to-GDP Ratio
Here, we are analysing the general goverment debts as the % of total GDP over period. This data is publicly available at Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) website. In consistency with bar chart above , Japan shows consistent growth in this debt value over period from 1995 till 2021.

##### KPI Cards : Year 2021 Debt-to-GDP Ratio

Here, I am assuming the target audience is interested in understanding the current 2021 Debt-to-GDP ratio. I am using a visual like KPI (key performance Indicator) here to show the 2021 Debt-to-GDP ratio values. This allows highlighting one value per country easily. With the right tool support, I would have loved to add the green or red arrow, indicating if the value is increasing or decreasing compared to the last year.

The color pallet I used here is like the blue color available on the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) website. I have also used different fonts to highlight appropriate text with the order of importance i.e., debt-to-GDP ratio, country name, and year. The inclusion of the header and footer gives correct background information about the visual. I feel this type of visualization is more appropriate as in the bar chart, some countries seem in the background i.e., gray color. The grid of line charts is not that easy to read but shows progress over the period. Thus, as per audience requirements, the combination of line chart and KPI indicators will be good for usage.
