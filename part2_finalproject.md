### User Research

#### Interview setup 
I followed below guidelines to take the user interveiwes. 

1. I Gave a brief introudction about myself and the intent of the experiment. 
2. The users did not know about my presentation topic beforehand and I did not give any insights about the topic. I allowed them to go through shorthand on their own.
3. I asked open ended questions like what/why in between and did not direct users in any particular context.

##### User Testing

Hello, I am Pooja, a student in the telling stories with data course.  My goal is to get feedback on this presentation I am designing.
