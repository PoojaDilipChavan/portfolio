### WireFraming

I used shorthand for outlining and putting in the sections of my final presentation.

### User Research

#### Interview setup 
I followed below guidelines to take the user interveiwes. 

1. I Gave a brief introudction about myself and the intent of the experiment. 
2. The users did not know about my presentation topic beforehand and I did not give any insights about the topic. I allowed them to go through shorthand on their own.
3. I asked open ended questions like what/why in between and did not direct users in any particular context.


##### User Testing 

Introduction \
Hello, I am Pooja, a student in the telling stories with data course.  My goal is to get feedback on this presentation I am designing. 
The inputs from the test will be used to improve the story further. This test should approximately take 10 minutes of your time.

<table>
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th> Questions </th>
         <th> User 1 - 23 year old female - Data Scientist  </th>
         <th> User 2 - 25 year old male - Consultant </th>
        <th>  User 3 - 24 year old female - Software Enginner </th>

      <tr>
         <td>1. What do you think this presentation is for? </td>
         <td>To highlight the importance of choosing the right brands and how that can affect the overall economic structure for a particular product e.g., Coffee. How important it is to be an aware consumer and how awareness about this is beneficial for farmers (who are putting in hard work instead of middlemen)</td>
         <td>Disproportionate distribution of revenue generated in coffee business</td>
         <td>It’s basically about coffee and getting profits for farmers by talking about fair trade pricing.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>2. Who do you think is the audience for this?</td>
         <td>Any mindless buyer who can be converted into an aware consumer is the audience for this.</td>
         <td>Everyday customers or anyone who drinks coffee</td>
         <td>I think people drinking about coffee, coffee stores that stores brands of coffee store multiple brands.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>3. How do you think data points/charts were presented here?</td>
         <td>A wide variety of visualization types and also presented in logical flow to better understand how data is contributing to the actual cause. By using global statistics, the problem is presented in a holistic view instead of being confined to a particular geographical location.</td>
         <td>Couldn't find a lot of them, a chart of coffee production vs consumption can be something that can be introduced</td>
         <td>I like the bean map and coffee production the bar chart looks good. There is only graph about farmer earnings, I would like to see more.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>4. Are there any parts you found confusing?</td>
         <td>Where the money spent on coffee is going if not to farmers? Because as a user it’s confusing to me to see such a widely popular product being paid for exorbitantly on a global level is not contributing to the maker of the product.</td>
         <td> No, the presentation captured the attention by subsequent, and distinct yet corollary topics</td>
         <td>The section on the empty cup for growers is a little confusing. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>5. If given a chance, what parts would you change about this presentation?</td>
         <td>I would elaborate more on how money is extracted by the middlemen and how exactly is the cash flow cycle going from production to retail sales.</td>
         <td>The presentation flow is great. The only minor that I can think of introducing a better transition between Empty cup for growers and coffee journey</td>
         <td>Your initial slides are interactive but later white colored slides look a little empty.  If you can add a short video 30 sec. Rethink static charts to see if they can be converted to an animated format.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>6. What other questions do you have about this presentation?</td>
         <td>Probably a comparative study between sustainable and non-sustainable products. Also how much difference in $ or % would be made by one individual user </td>
         <td>How likely is it that I can find sustainable Coffee brands in my area?Is shifting to packaged coffee an option?</td>
         <td>No more questions </td>
