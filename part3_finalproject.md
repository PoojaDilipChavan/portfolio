### Part 3

#### Interview Feedback 
I followed the comments from interview panel and submission comments to improve on the part 3 of this project.
Following is the summary of improvment areas and how I resolved them in the final part of the project.

<table>
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th> Elaborate more on how money is extracted by the middlemen  </th>
         <td>This feedback was incorporated by implementing a donut chart visualization with a cost breakdown on each step of the supply chain. I found prices for each step of the coffee supply chain per coffee cup and highlighted the growing/farming step in the visualization. </td>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <th> How likely is it that I can find sustainable Coffee brands in my area? </th>
         <td>I highly appreciate this feedback as even I was looking for this solution as a conscious coffee buyer. I presented easily available and famous sustainable coffee brands as examples that are shipped through Amazon USA. I also provided a fairtrade website link for more coffee options.</td>
      </tr>  
      <tr>
      <th> Introducing a better transition between Empty cups for growers and the coffee journey </th>
      <td>Through this feedback in part 2, I realized people were getting confused due to the coffee journey steps as another topic in the story. Thus, I added a new title clearly stating why coffee farmers are poor and added 2-6 middlemen in the supply chain as the reason farmers are not earning more. </td>
      </tr>  
      <tr>  
         <th>  Create a persona(Comment by TA) </th>
         <td>To set up the story and emphasis the lower earnings by the farmer, I created a persona called lily who works as a coffee farmer and gave details about how much money she is making through this business.</td>
      </tr>  
   </tbody>
</table>

#### Other Changes made for part 3

I also added a few new data points and visualizations to set up the conflict and resolution better â€“
1.	Deep dive to find out why farmers are poor - 
I found one of the major reasons i.e., small farm size. 80% of coffee farmers are small landowners and thus this is one of the major issues. I also built 3 case scenarios to represent small farmer vs large landowner earnings. I also added a matrix and scatterplot visualization to support my findings.
2.	Compare income per capita for coffee-origin countries and temperate (other Europe and USA) countries -
To support how the geographical locations of coffee-originating countries affect the poverty of farmers I focused on tropical underdevelopment due to health and education issues. It results in lower income per capita and thus a lower currency rate for farmers.
3.	Clear Call to Action - 
I added a clear call to action by adding a direct link to fairtrade coffees and promoting brands that are easily available on Amazon USA.
4.	Finalized Visualizations - 
In part 2 of the project, I had some placeholders/images for visualizations. For the final version, I cleaned up the visualizations on flourish by adding appropriate titles, colors, and labels.
5.	Reviewed it with peers - 
I gave a quick tour of my shorthand to my interview panel and gathered their final feedback. It allowed me to tweak some UI features like changing the opacity of the background images.
