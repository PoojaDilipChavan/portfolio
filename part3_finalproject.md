I followed the comments from interview panel and submission comments to improve on the part 3 of this project.
Following is the summary of improvment areas and how I resolved them in the final part of the project.

<table>
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th> Elaborate more on how money is extracted by the middlemen  </th>
           <td>This feedback was incorporated by implementing a donut chart visualization with a cost breakdown on each step of the supply chain. I found prices for each step of the coffee supply chain per coffee cup and highlighted the growing/farming step in the visualization. </td>
        <th>  Create a persona ( Comment by TA) </th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
          <th> How likely is it that I can find sustainable Coffee brands in my area? </th>
         <td>I highly appreciate this feedback as even I was looking for this solution as a conscious coffee buyer. I presented easily available and famous sustainable coffee brands as examples that are shipped through Amazon USA. I also provided a fairtrade website link for more coffee options.</td>
      </tr>  
      <tr>
      <th> Introducing a better transition between Empty cups for growers and the coffee journey </th>
      <td>Through this feedback in part 2, I realized people were getting confused due to the coffee journey steps as another topic in the story. Thus, I added a new title clearly stating why coffee farmers are poor and added 2-6 middlemen in the supply chain as the reason farmers are not earning more. </td>
      </tr>  
      <tr>  
         <td>To set up the story and emphasis the lower earnings by the farmer, I created a persona called lily who works as a coffee farmer and gave details about how much money she is making through this business.</td>
