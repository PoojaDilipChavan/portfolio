  My work in data and analytics team for oil & gas industry has allowed me to witness how shifting gears to digital has drastically changed the way we handle business. Technology can bring power to any job, from managing logistics efficiently to raising remedy tickets to the support team. 
  In my previous work as a Business Intelligence Developer at Schlumberger , I have achieved comprehensive expertise in data preparation, data modelling and visualization by using Microsoft Azure cloud stack â€“ data factory, analysis Services and Power BI. My recent internship at Amazon Web Services as a data engineer gave me an opprtunity to build scalable, secure ETL pipelines using airflow for analytics. I also worked on natural langauge processing problems to automate business processes.
  I am committed to bringing enlightening business conversations which give users the required answers and not just data.

## What I hope to Learn !
Having worked as a Business Intelligence developer earlier, I created many visulization reports. I understand the importance of easy to navigate, informative and aestincally pleasing reports. I hope to learn color theroy , best UI practices and creating user friendly reports.

In future , I see myself working in data analysis working backwords with customers and building holistic business solutions.

#### Assignmentdata: Visualizing government debt
In this assignment, I have worked on 'The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)' data - particularly Government Debt visualization.
The goal of the assignment is to understand chart types and recreate visualization in flourish (a tool for creating charts) with appropriate formatting and colors.
It also involved recreating another visualization tailored to a different user audience.

#### Assignment 3 & 4 - Critque by Design
I learned various skills through this assignment including critique, wireframing, user testing and building the solution.
It involves finding a publicly accessible data visulization and source, critiqueing the chart and then redesinging it. The redesign step involves wireframing for which I used tool Balsamiq Wireframe. After this I performed user testing by showing my wireframe to the potential audience and asking clarifying open-ended questions to them. I used this feedback to further enhance my redesigned visualization and then built my chart using tableau.
